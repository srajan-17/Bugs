# Bugs

## This is a website that takes an image of some insect that is uploaded by the user, and identifies the species of insect that it is.

## To run the website the python file "image_submit2.py" must first run, using the command below:

```$ python image_submit2.py```

## The website primarily uses an API from Clarifai for the image recognition capability, and is written using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Python.
